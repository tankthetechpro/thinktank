# XL Entertainment Group Malware Removal Project Results


Welcome to the results page of the XL Entertainment Group Malware Removal Project! In this project, we were contracted by XL Entertainment Group to remove malware from their business network and implement GRC policies to prevent future incidents.


## Project Overview


Our team, Tank the Tech Pro LLC, was contracted by XL Entertainment Group to remove malware from their business network. We identified that several computers on their network were infected with malware due to the use of various USB drives and downloads from unknown sources during the music recording process.


We conducted a thorough scan of their network using Qualys and Tenable scanning solutions, and were able to identify and remove over 15,000 instances of malware. We also implemented a GRC framework to track, monitor, and manage performance in regards to vulnerability identification, metrics reporting, and remediation efforts.


## Results


The results of this project were significant. We were able to remove all instances of malware from the XL Entertainment Group network, ensuring that their computers were safe to use and their sensitive information was secure.


In addition, our implementation of GRC policies has provided a long-term solution for XL Entertainment Group. By implementing policies such as a USB device and internet downloading policy, we were able to prevent future incidents of malware being introduced into their network. This will save XL Entertainment Group time and money in the long run by preventing network outages and the need to replace infected computers.


## Conclusion


Overall, the XL Entertainment Group Malware Removal Project was a success. We were able to identify and remove all instances of malware from their network and implement GRC policies to prevent future incidents. We hope that this project serves as a model for other businesses to follow when it comes to cybersecurity and GRC principles.
