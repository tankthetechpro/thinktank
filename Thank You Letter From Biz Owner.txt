Dear Tank,


I wanted to take a moment to thank you for the exceptional work you did in helping us with our recent malware issue. Your professionalism, expertise, and attention to detail were truly impressive.


Though the incident caused significant disruption to our business operations we thankfully were able to recover without substantial financial impact.  Your prompt response and ability to quickly identify and remove the malware allowed us to get back up and running much faster than we anticipated.


Your work not only helped us avoid potential financial loss and reputational damage, but also provided us with valuable insight into how to prevent similar issues in the future. We appreciate your partnership and look forward to working with you in the future.


Thank you again for your exceptional work.


Sincerely,




Mike Moon
